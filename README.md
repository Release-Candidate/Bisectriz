The angle bisector of the two given angles is always calculated counterclockwise from the smaller to the bigger angle, the order in the input fields does not matter. The two angles are given as zodiac sign -- starting at aries (0째), ending at pisces (330째) -- the rest given in degrees between 0째 and 29째 (inclusive) and minutes between 0' and 59' (inclusive).
